Hello,

My name Gage, and I'm currently working on my Bachelor's(and then Master's) degree in Cybersecurity and Computer Science at Dakota State University. I've got some funky math programs and CTF writeups for right now. Maybe I'll add some tools and other stuff I've made soon.

If you have any questions or want to contact me, the best way is through my email attached to my account.

Thanks for stopping by!
