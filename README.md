Hello,

My name Gage, and I'm currently working on my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Dakota State University. I fell in love with coding after a class in school when I was 12 years old. Most of my programs have to do with mathematics, one of my favorite uses for programming.

If you have any questions or want to contact me, the best way is through my email attached to my account.

Thanks for stopping by!
